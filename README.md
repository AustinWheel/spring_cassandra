# Test Application with Spring Cassandra
This is a super simple application that goes over the basics of using spring and cassandra together. Currently it just inserts some data and prints the results. Most of the concepts touch on how to setup methods and classes to interact with the database.

The database is hosted locally via docker. The guide I used to set it up can be found [here](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-cassandra).
